       "\"Building an NFT marketplace for your AI application is an exciting project that involves several key components, including smart contracts, a user interface, a blockchain network, and potentially a backend server. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you might take to build an NFT marketplace:\\n\\n1. **Choose a Blockchain Platform**: The first step is to choose a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and NFT standards. Ethereum is the most popular choice due to its widespread use and the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token standards for NFTs. Other options include Binance Smart Chain, Flow by Dapper Labs, Tezos, and more.\\n\\n2. **Design Smart Contracts**: You'll need to write smart contracts for minting NFTs, transferring ownership, and possibly for auctioning or selling NFTs. These contracts will handle the business logic of your marketplace.\\n\\n3. **Develop the Frontend**: The user interface is where users will interact with your marketplace. It should be intuitive and provide functionalities like browsing NFTs, viewing details, listing NFTs for sale, purchasing, and wallet integration.\\n\\n4. **Backend Infrastructure**: Depending on your needs, you might require a backend to handle off-chain functionalities like user accounts, notifications, indexing NFTs, etc.\\n\\n5. **IPFS for Asset Storage**: Since storing large files on the blockchain is impractical, you'll likely use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or another decentralized storage solution for storing the actual digital assets associated with NFTs.\\n\\n6. **Integrate a Wallet**: Users will need a way to interact with the blockchain, typically through a web3 wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet.\\n\\n7. **Testing**: Before going live, thoroughly test your smart contracts and platform to ensure security and functionality.\\n\\n8. **Deployment**: Once everything is tested, you can deploy your smart contracts to the blockchain and launch your marketplace.\\n\\nAs for open-source code repositories, there are several projects you can use as a starting point or for reference:\\n\\n- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: OpenZeppelin provides a library of secure and community-vetted smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains, which can be used to create ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens.\\n\\n  GitHub: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\\n\\n- **OpenSea**: OpenSea has some of its SDK and other resources available on GitHub, which can be helpful for understanding how a large marketplace operates.\\n\\n  GitHub: https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea\\n\\n- **Rarible Protocol**: Rarible has an open-source protocol that you can use to build your own NFT marketplace.\\n\\n  GitHub: https://github.com/rarible/protocol\\n\\n- **Foundation**: The Foundation marketplace has some of its contracts open-sourced.\\n\\n  GitHub: https://github.com/f8n/fnd-protocol\\n\\nRemember to comply with the licenses of these open-source projects when using their code. Also, consider the security implications of using third-party code; always perform audits and reviews to ensure the safety of your platform.\\n\\nLastly, given the complexity and potential security risks involved in blockchain development, it's often advisable to work with experienced developers or consult with blockchain development firms if you're not experienced in this area. Security audits by reputable firms are also strongly recommended before launching any financial platform.\""

It also includes the ability to set and update the platform fee. The contract uses a counter to assign unique IDs to each listing.\\n\\nPlease remember that this contract does not handle royalties to the NFT creator, as the ERC-721 standard does not define a royalty mechanism. You would need to integrate with a standard like EIP-2981 or a custom royalty logic within the NFT contract itself.\\n\\nAlso, this contract does not include all the getter methods you requested, nor does it handle ERC-20 payments for gas optimization reasons. You would need to add additional checks and logic to handle ERC-20 payments securely.\\n\\nLastly, the upgradability feature is only hinted at here. You would need to deploy the implementation contract, then deploy a `ProxyAdmin`, and finally deploy a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` with the address of the implementation and the `ProxyAdmin`. The proxy contract would then be used by users to interact with the marketplace.\\n\\nBefore deploying any smart contract, make sure to test it thoroughly and consider having it audited by professionals.'"

The `listNFTForSale` function allows a user to list their NFT for sale, the `buyNFT` function allows a user to purchase a listed NFT, and the `updateListingPrice` function allows the seller to update the price of their listing. The `updatePlatformFee` function allows the owner of the contract to update the platform fee.\\n\\nPlease note that this contract does not handle royalties to the NFT creator, as this would require additional logic and potentially a royalty standard like EIP-2981. You would need to integrate such logic based on the specific NFT contract you are working with.\\n\\nAlso, the contract does not include the actual proxy setup code. You would need to deploy a `ProxyAdmin` contract and a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract separately, then initialize the `NFTMarketplace` contract through the proxy to make it upgradable.\\n\\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract on test networks and conduct a security audit before deploying it to the Ethereum mainnet.'"
